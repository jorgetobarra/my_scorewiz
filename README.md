# My Scorewiz

A desktop app to add votes for a Eurovision-like competition and display the results with tense expectation.
Built with React, Electron and MUI.

Go to the package.json and execute the correspondent build command to generate an app for your OS. But don't forget the `npm i` before that!

This project was built years ago to solve a necessity, so don't expect code excellency 😂 But it does work wonderfully.
